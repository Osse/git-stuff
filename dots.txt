             \
              \
               I - J - K - L  feature

log, rev-list, cherry-pick, ...
===============================

feature..master = E F G H

master..feature = I J K l

master...feature = feature...master = E F G H I J K L


git diff specifically:
======================

master..feature = feature master = L H

master...feature = $(git merge-base feature master) master = D L
