Example history:
================

A - B - C - D - E - F - G - H  master
             \
              \
               I - J - K - L  feature

NOTE: The meaning changes based on what git subcommand you run.

log, rev-list, cherry-pick, ...
===============================

These usages of dots resolve to a *set* of commits:

feature..master = E F G H

master..feature = I J K L

master...feature = feature...master = E F G H I J K L


git diff specifically:
======================

git diff produces a comparison between two commits so these usages always
resolve to *two* commits:

master..feature = master feature = H L

master...feature = $(git merge-base feature master) master = D L

feature...master = $(git merge-base master feature) feature = D H

For example: 'git diff feature...master' is the same as 'git diff D H'.
